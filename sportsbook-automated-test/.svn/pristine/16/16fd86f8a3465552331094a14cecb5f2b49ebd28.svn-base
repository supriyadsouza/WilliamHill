AIM:

We would like you to Automate a Manual Test Script via Selenium.

This Automated Test is to be executed using JUnit, and also utilises a databank File.

You have been supplied with the following:
* /databank.csv - The databank which we want the BrowerTest to run from
* /ManualTestScript.txt - The Manual Test you are attempting to Automate
* src/main - CSVReader - Used to read in a CSV File
* src/test - CSVReaderTest - JUnit covering the CSVReader Class
* src/test - SportsbookBrowserTest - The Selenium JUnit test


OBJECTIVE:

Currently the CSVReaderTest & SportsbookBrowserTest are innadequate, we need you to improve them.

1) Ensure the SportsbookBrowserTest contains the correct Test Assertions

2) Ensure the SportsbookBrowserTest is databank driven.

3) Add Assertions to the CSVReaderTest where you think appropriate

--It is expected that you follow standard Java Programming Guidlines (Commenting, JUnit setup/teardown etc)


DO NOT MODIFY:

* CSVReader Class
* ManualTestScript.txt
* databank.csv
